# DS340H_Nile_Rankin-Watson
Data Science Senior Capstone

This is my senior capstone for the data science major at Wellesley College. This capstone was created in conjunction with the DS 340H class, where we were given a dataset to clean, analyze, and fit a model based on a research question of our choice. 

As a graduating data science major with a concentration in political science, I have learned about statistics and computer science from the lens of a political scientist. I have become fluent in R, Python, Stata and SQL.
